This is a mock Flask application designed for demonstration purposes. It includes a login page and an emergency registration page. Users can enter their credentials or emergency information, and upon successful submission, they will be redirected to a home page.

## Pages

- **Emergency Registration Page**: Users can submit emergency information, including patient name, condition, and location.
- **Redirect on Success**: After successful form submissions, users are redirected to a home page.
- **Basic Form Validation**: Ensures that required fields are not left blank before submission.
